# Data Structure Manager

## Overview

The `DataStructureManager` is a C++ application designed to manage records using multiple data structures. It integrates a `vector`, `list`, `stack`, `queue`, and `unordered_map` to provide various functionalities for inserting, deleting, searching, and retrieving records. This project is a practical implementation of these fundamental data structures and demonstrates how they can be utilized together.

## Features

- **Insert Record:** Add a record to all supported data structures.
- **Delete Record:** Remove a record by its ID from all data structures.
- **Search Record:** Check for the existence of a record by its ID in all data structures.
- **Retrieve Latest Record:** Get the most recently added record from the stack.
- **Retrieve Oldest Record:** Get the oldest record from the queue.
- **Retrieve Record by Key:** Fetch a record from the unordered map using its ID.
- **Display Records:** Show all records stored in each data structure.

## Data Structures Used

- **Vector:** For storing records in a dynamic array.
- **List:** For storing records in a doubly-linked list.
- **Stack:** For managing records in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
- **Queue:** For managing records in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
- **Unordered Map:** For storing records with quick access via a hash table.
